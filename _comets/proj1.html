<div class="projeto1">
  <p class="introproj1">For this project, during my Master Degree in Design and Multimedia I tried to solve a recurring
    problem in college - the garbage. </p>
  <p>This way I came up with a solution - an innovative and funny bin that would allow the students 
    of the University of Coimbra to vote on as many different topics as they wanted.</p>

  <p>Besides voting through garbage, I made a website that allowed students to vote on the options 
    they would like to see in the future in other bins in their universities and, if they wanted, 
    suggest other options. They could also see the votes in real time to follow without being in person.</p>
  <p>So first, I started by making the bin. This was a long but fun process!</p>

  <p class="afterproj1">After I needed some posters with the options for the students to vote with their garbage!</p>
  <div class="cartazes">

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cartaz2.jpg" alt="cartaz cor de rosa"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cartaz3.jpg" alt="cartaz roxo"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cartaz4.jpg" alt="cartaz preto"/>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cartaz6.jpg" alt="cartaz verde"/>
  </div>


  <p>I also did a promotional video to show people how it works!</p>

  </video></p>

  <p>The second part was making the website. The CleanChoice website promotes cleaning the University of Coimbra with simply trash. 
    The website also allows people to know more about the project and vote for next ideas.</p>

<div id="projeto6">
  <p>Since I'm very interested in UI, I decided to do some experiments
    myself and create my own interface to an app.
    I had a project stopped some time ago from a fashion store and
    I decided to take it and give it life, because it still had no interface or
    implementation, it only had graphic images.
    It was challenging, mainly because I did everything in 2 days as some kind
    of personal challenge but I loved it! In the future I want to add more
    components and improve others and who knows even develop it!</p>

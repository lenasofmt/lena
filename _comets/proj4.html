<div class="projeto4">
    <p>The aim of this project was to carry out six pictograms alluding to the following countries: Iran,
        Israel, Greece, Armenia, Japan and Ethiopia.
        Some of the topics considered by me were:
        - Types of bottles
        - Types of jars
        - Standards
        - Flowers
        - Offensive gestures in the respective countries</p>

        <p>I have decided to opt for the topic of offensive gestures in the countries in question. 
        I think that when we move to a certain country with a different culture,
        sometimes we are unaware that some of our most banal gestures can be interpreted
        in a completely different way, in this case, offensive.</p>
        <p>So, I went through the different types of offensive gestures, trying to find six that were
            very different between themselves and after I did some sketches to fit the theme into pictograms. </p>
        <p>I tried to use very geometric shapes, geometrizing the hands I drew in pictogram.</p>
        <p>Keywords: gestures, multiculturalism, offenses.</p>

    <p>Handshake with the left hand - Offensive gesture in Ethiopia. The use of the left hand is generally considered offensive
        in Ethiopia, as well as the hand-shaking with the left hand.</p>
    <p>Mountza - Offensive gesture in Greece. This is the most traditional gesture of insult among Greeks
        which consists of reaching out all the fingers and presenting the palm of your hand to the person being insulted.</p>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/pictograma2.jpg" alt="pictograma2"/>
    <p>Over-consumption of alcohol - Offensive gesture in Israel. Israel being a country with strong 
        religious traditions, at the time sacred the consumption of alcohol is considered an offense.</p>
    <p>Aiming with chopsticks - Offensive gesture in Japan. This gesture is considered even more 
        offensive than pointing out with your fingers for someone or something.</p>

    <p>Thumbs up - Offensive gesture in Iran. In this country it is an offensive gesture, 
        equivalent to the use of the middle finger in the West.</p>

    <p>Fig Sign - Offensive gesture in Armenia. This offensive gesture is usually used to refuse
        a request. It's a common and very rude gesture, similar to the middle finger.</p>
